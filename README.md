## Installation
This is a React Native project. Running the following commands from terminal/CL will ensure a swift start. 
1. Clone the repo with

2. This app uses Expo Client as a primary build tool. Follow React Native [Getting Started with Expo CLI Quickstart](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) for easy set up.
